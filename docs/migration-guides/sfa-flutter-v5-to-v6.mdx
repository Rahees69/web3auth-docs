This migration guide provides steps for upgrading from version v5 to v6 of the SFA Flutter SDK. The
guide outlines significant changes and enhancements, including the support of `logout` method, and
changes in `LoginParams`.

## Breaking Changes

### `SingleFactAuthFlutter` is now renamed to `SingleFactorAuthFlutter`

In v6, we have fixed the typo for the `SingleFactAuthFlutter`. Now you can use
`SingleFactorAuthFlutter` to initialize the SDK.

```dart
// remove-next-line
final singleFactAuthFlutter = SingleFactAuthFlutter();
// add-next-line
final singleFactorAuthFlutter = SingleFactorAuthFlutter();
```

### `SFAParams` is now renamed to `Web3AuthOptions`

In v6, we try to improve the developer experience by renaming the `SFAParams` to `Web3AuthOptions`.
The change has been made to align with naming conventions across Web3Auth SDKs.

```dart
final singleFactorAuthFlutter = SingleFactorAuthFlutter();

await singleFactorAuthFlutter.init(
    // focus-start
    // remove-next-line
    SFAParams(
    // add-next-line
    Web3AuthOptions(
        network: Web3AuthNetwork.mainnet,
        clientId: "YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID",
    ),
    // focus-end
);
```

### `SFAKey` is now renamed to `SessionData`

In v6, the `SFAKey` is now renamed to `SessionData`. This change was made to align with the naming
conventions across Web3Auth SDKs. Please check the [SessionData](#sessiondata) type for more
details.

```dart
// remove-next-line
final SFAKey key = await singleFactorAuthFlutter.connect(
// add-next-line
final SessionData sessionData = await singleFactorAuthFlutter.connect(
    LoginParams(
        verifier: 'YOUR_VERIFIER_NAME',
        verifierId: "VERIFIER_ID",
        idToken: "ID_TOKEN",
    ),
);
```

### isSessionIdExists is replaced with isConnected

The `isSessionIdExists` method is replaced with the `isConnected` method to check whether the user
is logged in Web3Auth or not. Please note, the `isConnected` method should be used after the
`initialize` method.

```dart
// remove-next-line
final bool isSessionIdExists = await singleFactorAuthFlutter.isSessionIdExists();
// add-next-line
final bool isConnected = await singleFactorAuthFlutter.isConnected();
```

### Changes in `LoginParams`

In v6, the `aggregateVerifier` is replaced with `subVerifierInfoArray`. The `subVerifierInfoArray`
can be used to pass the sub verifier details when using an aggregate verifier.

Earlier, while using an aggregate verifier, the `verifier` was used to pass the sub verifier name.
After v6, the `verifier` will take the aggregate verifier name, and sub verifier details can be
passed in `subVerifierInfoArray`.

```dart
final loginParams = LoginParams(
    // remove-next-line
    verifier: "SUB_VERIFIER_NAME",
    // add-next-line
    verifier: "AGGREGATE_VERIFIER_NAME",
    verifierId: "VERIFIER_ID",
    idToken: "ID_TOKEN",
    // remove-next-line
    aggregateVerifier: "AGGREGATE_VERIFIER_NAME",
    // add-next-line
    subVerifierInfoArray: [
        TorusSubVerifierInfo(
            "SUB_VERIFIER_NAME",
            "ID_TOKEN",
        ),
    ],
);
```

## Additional Features

Apart from the breaking changes, we have added couple of new functions in v6 to improve the
developer experience.

### logout Method

The `logout` method is added to the SDK to log out the user and clear the session data. Please note,
that this method only logout the user and invalides the Web3Auth session, and not the OAuth provider
session.

```dart
try {
    await singleFactorAuthFlutter.logout();
} catch (e) {
    // Handle the error
}
```

### getSessionData Method

The `getSessionData` method is added to the SDK to get the session data. You can use this method to
retrive the session data for an existing session. The method will return `null` if the user does not
have an existing session. Please note, the `getSessionData` method should be used after the
`initialize` method.

#### Usage

```dart
final SessionData? sessionData = await singleFactorAuthFlutter.getSessionData();

if (sessionData == null) {
    // User does not have an existing session
}
```

#### SessionData

The `SessionData` has the following properties to retrive the relevant session information.

| Name            | Description                                                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `privateKey`    | Retrieves the user's private key.                                         |
| `publicAddress` | Retrieves the user's public address.                                      |
| `userInfo?`     | Retrieves the user's information like email, name, verifier id, and more. |
| `signatures?`   | Retrieves the node's signatures that are returned for request.            |
