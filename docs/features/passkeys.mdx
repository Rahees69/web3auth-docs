Passkeys offer a secure, passwordless authentication method, enhancing user experience with the
WebAuthn standard. Web3Auth supports passkeys via its Single Factor Auth (SFA) Web SDK, enabling
seamless developer integration.

### Key Benefits of Passkeys

#### Convenience

- **Passwordless Login:** Users can authenticate without the need for passwords, reducing friction
  and improving the overall user experience.
- **Biometric Authentication:** Passkeys support biometric methods such as fingerprint or facial
  recognition, offering a quick and secure way to log in.

#### Security

- **Phishing Resistant:** Passkeys are inherently phishing-resistant, as they use public-key
  cryptography and are bound to the origin they were created for, making it difficult for attackers
  to intercept or misuse them.
- **Strong Authentication:** Passkeys provide a strong form of authentication, leveraging the
  security features of the user's device.

#### Seamless Integration

- **Web3Auth SFA SDK Compatibility:** The Passkeys SFA Plugin integrates seamlessly with Web3Auth
  Single Factor Auth (SFA) Web SDK, enabling easy implementation of passkey registration, login, and
  management functionalities.
