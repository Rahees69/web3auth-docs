## Can’t Find Your Chain?

Web3Auth supports the secp256k1 and ed25519 key curves, please follow these guides on how to
[connect to any other blockchain](/connect-blockchain/other/) with Web3Auth.

### Extending beyond default curves

Our SFA and PnP SDKs support additional curves, allowing integration with blockchains that have
unique curve requirements. This broadens compatibility and flexibility across ecosystems.

Use the [CommonPrivateKeyProvider](/sdk/pnp/web/providers/common) to connect to any blockchain that
uses a different curve than secp256k1 or ed25519.
