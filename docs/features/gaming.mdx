Unity and Unreal are the powerhouses behind thousands of games, driving immersive experiences across
platforms and genres. With Web3Auth's SDKs, blockchain features like wallet authentication and
in-game transactions aren’t just added, they’re seamlessly embedded into the heart of your game.

Here's how you can use our SDKs to create richer, more engaging experiences:

1. **Easy Player Login and Item Management:** Let players log in and manage blockchain-based items
   right in the game. With Web3Auth, players can securely access their wallet and use their NFT
   items without leaving the game.

2. **Completely embedded with UI:** Make the wallet and blockchain interactions seamless and
   invisible to your players. This ensures that their gaming experience remains immersive, with all
   blockchain operations happening effortlessly in the background.

3. **In-Game NFT Marketplace:** Build an in-game shop where players can securely buy, sell, or trade
   blockchain-based items like skins, characters, or collectibles.

4. **Blockchain-Enabled Multiplayer Features:** Enable secure blockchain transactions in multiplayer
   games, like wagering on matches or sharing resources for co-op missions.
