## NFT Checkout

The NFT Checkout by Web3Auth is designed to facilitate a seamless end-to-end experience for minting
NFTs, processing payments, and delivering the minted NFTs to users. This service supports various
fiat payment methods, including credit and debit cards, ensuring a smooth transaction process.

#### How it works

The Web3Auth SDK can launch a checkout modal within the app that guides users through the complete
payment and minting process. Once the transaction is complete, the user's wallet will contain the
minted NFT, and they will be prompted the same in the app. Web3Auth supports ERC-721 and ERC-1155
smart contracts across all EVM-compatible networks.

#### Key Features

- **Customizable Whitelabel UI:** Integrate and tailor the user interface to align with your brand's
  look and feel effortlessly.
- **Minting Control:** Set specific limits on minting and determine the pricing that suits your
  requirements.

## NFT Minting

The NFT Minting API by Web3Auth is designed to facilitate the minting process for specified NFTs,
supporting large-scale, gasless minting via our advanced batch minting infrastructure. This API is
ideal for scenarios such as Airdrops, free mints, and situations where you prefer to manage fiat
payments on your own.

#### How it works

To initiate the minting process, simply provide the API with the necessary contract details, token
ID, and recipient wallet address. The Web3Auth infrastructure will take care of the rest, ensuring a
seamless and efficient minting experience. Web3Auth supports ERC-721 and ERC-1155 smart contracts
across all EVM-compatible networks.

#### Key Features

- **Control Over Fiat Payments:** Manage fiat payments independently to suit your projectâ€™s needs.
- **Custom Authorization Requirements:** Implement additional security measures, such as
  whitelisting addresses that are authorized to mint NFTs.
- **Webhook Notifications:** Register webhook endpoints to receive real-time updates on transaction
  status.
- **Gas Fees Covered:** Web3Auth handles all gas fees associated with the minting process, ensuring
  a cost-effective solution.
