## How Plug and Play Works

Here's a visual representation of the high-level flow:

1. Users lands on your dApp
2. User initiates login (via Web3Auth Modal)
3. User logins using OAuth/ social login
4. User authenticated (via auth.web3auth.io)
5. User logins to your dapp (with application scoped key)
